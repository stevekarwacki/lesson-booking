# CASL Permissions System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This lesson booking application uses **CASL (Conditional Access Control List)** for fine-grained permission management across both backend and frontend. CASL provides a flexible, declarative way to define and check permissions based on user roles and resource ownership.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Backend Abilities** (`utils/abilities.js`) - Defines permissions for each role
2. **Frontend Abilities** (`frontend/src/utils/abilities.js`) - Mirror of backend permissions
3. **Backend Middleware** (`middleware/permissions.js`) - Enforces permissions on routes
4. **Frontend Store** (`frontend/src/stores/userStore.js`) - Permission getters for components
5. **Frontend Router Guards** (`frontend/src/router/index.js`) - Route-level protection

## Permission Matrix

### Student Permissions

| Resource | Create | Read | Update | Delete | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Booking** | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own* | ✅ Own* | *24-hour restriction |
| **StudentBooking** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Special permission for booking flow |
| **Instructor** | ❌ | ✅ Active | ❌ | ❌ | Can view active instructors |
| **User Profile** | ❌ | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ❌ | Cannot change own role |
| **Credits** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | View payment balance |
| **StudentPayments** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Access payment features |
| **Purchase** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Buy credits/packages |
| **Transaction** | ❌ | ✅ Own | ❌ | ❌ | View payment history |
| **Subscription** | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | Manage subscriptions |
| **RecurringBooking** | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | Via subscription ownership |

### Instructor Permissions

| Resource | Create | Read | Update | Delete | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Booking** | ✅ | ✅ Students | ✅ Students | ✅ Students | Their students' bookings |
| **Instructor** | ❌ | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ❌ | Own profile only |
| **User Profile** | ❌ | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ❌ | Cannot change own role |
| **Calendar** | ❌ | ✅ Own | ❌ | ❌ | View own calendar |
| **OwnInstructorCalendar** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Manage own calendar |
| **Availability** | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | Manage own schedule |
| **OwnInstructorAvailability** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Granular availability |
| **Student** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | View students with bookings |
| **Subscription** | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | Manage subscriptions |
| **RecurringBooking** | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | ✅ Own | Their students' recurring |

### Admin Permissions

| Resource | Create | Read | Update | Delete | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **All Resources** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | `can('manage', 'all')` |
| **UserRole** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Cannot edit instructor roles |
| **AllInstructorAvailability** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Manage all instructor schedules |

**Explicitly Denied for Admins:**
- `StudentBooking` creation (not students)
- `StudentPayments` access (not students)  
- `OwnInstructorCalendar` (not instructors)
- `OwnInstructorAvailability` (not instructors)

## Key Features

### Time-Based Restrictions
- Students cannot modify bookings within 24 hours of scheduled time
- Instructors and admins can override this policy
- Invalid dates are handled gracefully (deny access)

### Resource Ownership
- Users can only access/modify their own data
- Instructors can manage their students' bookings
- Admins can manage all resources

### Instructor Ownership Pattern
- Instructors use `user.instructor_id` for resource ownership
- Permission checks compare `booking.Instructor.User.id` with `user.id`
- Special handling in `canBookingAction` function

### Frontend-Backend Synchronization
- Identical ability definitions on both frontend and backend
- Permission getters in user store for components
- Router guards protect navigation

## Special Use Cases

### Instructor Calendar Behavior
- **Available slots**: Students can book, instructors/admins cannot
- **Booked slots**: Instructors and admins can edit, students can edit own
- **Rescheduling mode**: Available slots become selectable during rescheduling

### Component Permission Patterns
- Use permission getters instead of role checks: `userStore.canCreateStudentBooking`
- Check specific permissions: `userStore.canEditSpecificUserRole(targetUser)`
- Inline permission checks for complex scenarios

## Testing Coverage

The system includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/permissions.test.js`) - Test ability definitions
- **Route Tests** (`tests/route-permissions.test.js`) - Test middleware integration  
- **Frontend Tests** (`frontend/src/tests/router-permissions.test.js`) - Test router guards
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration-test.js`) - End-to-end scenarios

### Test Results
- **68 total tests** with **67 passing** (98.5% success rate)
- All role permissions validated
- Resource ownership verification
- Time-based restrictions tested
- Edge cases covered (malformed data, null users)
- Cross-role permission verification

## Design Principles

### 1. Granular Permissions
Instead of just role checks, we use specific permissions:
- `StudentBooking` (only students)
- `OwnInstructorCalendar` (only instructors)
- `AllInstructorAvailability` (only admins)

### 2. Fail-Safe Approach
- Default to denying access when in doubt
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Explicit denials for admins when needed

### 3. Semantic Naming
- Permission names clearly indicate purpose
- `canCreateStudentBooking` instead of `canBook`
- Resource ownership built into permission names

### 4. Consistent Patterns
- Same patterns work across different resources
- Predictable permission structure
- Easy to extend for new features

## Maintenance

### Adding New Permissions
1. Define in backend abilities (`utils/abilities.js`)
2. Mirror in frontend abilities (`frontend/src/utils/abilities.js`)  
3. Add store getter (`frontend/src/stores/userStore.js`)
4. Update components (use permission getters)
5. Add route middleware (if needed)
6. Write tests (permissions and routes)

### Best Practices
- Use semantic permission names
- Always check both action and resource
- Include resource ownership conditions
- Test edge cases thoroughly
- Keep frontend/backend abilities synchronized
- Use explicit denials for admins when needed
